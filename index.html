    <p class="rules">To start off this game, you will be given a random number. You will then have to click on the crystals and try to match your number with the number you were given. If you match it, congradulations! You've won! However, if you go over that number... you will lose. You must click on each crystal to find out how many numbers it has on it so you can estimate which ones you need to win the game. Good Luck!</p>
